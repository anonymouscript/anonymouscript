Hi Ya'll,  

Because some people have trouble writing good emails, I'd like to give you some advice on how to write better email. Please follow these guidelines. It makes reading your emails a lot easier.  

When starting an Email, you should use an appropiate greeting to the recipient, followed by a comma and a new line. Remember that an appropiate greeting will be different depending on who is recieving the Email (the main recipient(s) in the "To" box and the Others in the "Cc"/"Bcc"). Sometimes no greeting is needed, especially if it is followed by a short message, or is a reply to another message. 

The first two sentances should tell the recipient what you want them to do and why you want it. You should be very consise. Then, explain why the recipient should do what you want, unless its already clear, and provide **specific** instructions on how they would do what you want them to do. If you have a lot of information, lists, headed sections, paragraphs are helpful. The end of the Email should summarize what you want and what they should do next if the Email was long.

Before sending the Email, make sure to proofread it. This is different from short-form comminication (E.g. Texting) because you are generally expected to use propper grammar and spelling. In addition, make sure all your messages are clear as they are written. When the recipient reads the Email, they will not hear your tone of voice, and they may not have the context of recent of events, so make sure to be explicit.

TLDR; Be Explicit, Clear, and Concise with your Email.  

Please,
